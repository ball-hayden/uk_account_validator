UkAccountValidator
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ball-hayden/uk_account_validator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ball-hayden/uk_account_validator)

This gem validates uk account numbers against their sort codes in accordance with VocaLink's modulus checking specification, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.vocalink.com/tools/modulus-checking/).

Note that this gem ensures the sort code and account number are valid, not that they exist.

NB the resource text files valacdos.txt and scsubtab.txt are produced and released by VocaLink.

Requires Ruby > 2.0.0

Modulus weight table data can be found [here](https://www.vocalink.com/tools/modulus-checking/). (Last verified data was downloaded 2023-05-30).
